          Hello! I&apos;m Leo - the guy behind UCS. I&apos;m an Electrical Engineering graduate of Temple University
          where I sniped a 4.00 GPA. In 2021, I was selected as a Goldwater Scholar for my work in CNS
          drug discovery using machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a child I really loved LEGOs for how they would each snap together perfectly. I hated the stickers that
          would come with them though, because there was no way to put them on perfectly - especially with my clumbsy
          8-year-old fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coding has been like playing with LEGOs again. Thanks to the amazing work of generations of physicists,
          chemists, and electrical engineers, I get to live in this digital world where - with time and meticulousness -
          every bit can be set perfectly. And there are <em>almost</em> no stickers in sight ;)
